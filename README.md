# Corona Virus Prediction

The application predicts wether a person can be Covid-19 infected or not. This can be used to prioritize the covid tests on people.
This depends on factors:

- Fever Value
- Age
- Body Pain
- Runny Nose
- Breathing Difficulty

The model is trained using sklearn and logistic regression using the Kaggle coronavirus symptoms dataset.
